# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: Having graduated from McGill University with a degree in Computer Science, I not only gained an understanding of fundamental concepts such as data structures and algorithms, but also sharpened my time management and problem-solving skills. To apply my knowledge and technical proficiency in real-world scenarios, I pursued two internships during my degree. These internships at Flinks and Intact offered me invaluable experience with the financial sector and its technological applications. At Flinks, I worked with APIs and front-end development, while at Intact, I had the opportunity to explore cutting-edge software like Apache Airflow and Kubernetes. As a competitive powerlifter, I have instilled the importance of consistent hard work and adaptability, qualities that have become integral to my professional life.

    description:  "Implemented a Linux monitoring agent to collect hardware specifications and server resource usage of multiple Linux systems. The agent uses Bash scripts to fetch the data, and then stores them into a PostgreSQL database provisioned by Docker. To insure that the information gathered is up-to-date, Crontab is used to run the scripts automatically at a specific interval of time. SQL queries can be used on the data retrieved for analysis."
