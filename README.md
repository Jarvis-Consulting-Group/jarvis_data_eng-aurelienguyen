# Aurélie Nguyen . Jarvis Consulting

Having graduated from McGill University with a degree in Computer Science, I not only gained an understanding of fundamental concepts such as data structures and algorithms, but also sharpened my time management and problem-solving skills. To apply my knowledge and technical proficiency in real-world scenarios, I pursued two internships during my degree. These internships at Flinks and Intact offered me invaluable experience with the financial sector and its technological applications. At Flinks, I worked with APIs and front-end development, while at Intact, I had the opportunity to explore cutting-edge software like Apache Airflow and Kubernetes. As a competitive powerlifter, I have instilled the importance of consistent hard work and adaptability, qualities that have become integral to my professional life.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-aurelienguyen](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-aurelienguyen)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-aurelienguyen/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Implemented a Linux monitoring agent to collect hardware specifications and server resource usage of multiple Linux systems. The agent uses Bash scripts to fetch the data, and then stores them into a PostgreSQL database provisioned by Docker. To insure that the information gathered is up-to-date, Crontab is used to run the scripts automatically at a specific interval of time. SQL queries can be used on the data retrieved for analysis.


## Highlighted Projects

**DisposeRight** [[GitHub](https://github.com/aurelie-nguyen/DisposeRight)]: Implemented a residual neural network using PyTorch and cleaned the data. The Android mobile app written in Java takes a picture of an object and sorts it into one of the four following categories: garbage, recycling, compost, and other with an accuracy of 82%.
